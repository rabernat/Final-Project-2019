# Rose Oelkers Final Project Proposal

## Background

### Above is my  current standardized dataset for Ring width of white spruce tree-rings from Interior Alaska. Typically trees in the boreal forest are accurate recorders of mean summer temperature. Originally  cored in 1979 and updated in 2010, it was never published in a paper due to it's divergence from positive correlations to  mean temperature in the early 1980s. 

### I remeasured this site for ringwidth and density recently and found that the density of these same tree rings are still temperature sensitive.  I would like to understand why trees are growing less during this period by running multiple spectral, climate, and PC analysis (if there's time) for the Ring Width dataset.

## Question: Are trees in the SE brooks range suffering from temperature-induced drought Stress?


### Datasets for Seasonal climate analysis 

##### - Clean and standardized climate datasets , plot Spatial correlations

#### Gridded Temperature (mean,  max, min,),  Precip, 
- [CRU TS. v3.24.01 ](https://crudata.uea.ac.uk/cru/data/hrg/cru_ts_3.24.01/cruts.1701201703.v3.24.01/)

#### or from  KNMI, still from CRU, but may be able to save time cleaning
- [CRU TS. v4.03](https://climexp.knmi.nl/selectfield_obs2.cgi?id=someone@somewhere)

#### SPEI (drought index) based on CRU TS. v3.24.01
-[SPEI , current year seasonal (3, 6 month)](http://digital.csic.es/handle/10261/153475)
